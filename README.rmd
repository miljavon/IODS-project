This is the Introduction to open data science course in Helsinki unversity. 

My personal feelings about this course: something about this course intrigues me. These are really the skills i whish to learn in the future and that is why I'm very very excited. I hope that by learning all of this I will get a nice and interesting job where I can make an impact. 

We will see how this will go. Right now I'm fairly confindent, but letÂ´s see if that will change in the future.
